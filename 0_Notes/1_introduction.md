### Dual Paths in React

React has two main paths:

- **React DOM**: Focused on web applications.
- **React Native**: Focused on mobile application development.

## Summary

React JS is a powerful library for front-end development, best suited for SPAs. Although it has limitations in SEO and state management, its simplicity in building dynamic UIs has made it a popular choice for developers worldwide. Next.js, a framework built on React, extends React's capabilities, offering better SEO support and various rendering options for more complex applications.
