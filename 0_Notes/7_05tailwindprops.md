  React say that don't write everything Separately write at one place.

  - create a folder in src folder of name components.
  - write rfce it will give react components easily using react snippet extension.

  ```
  import React from 'react'
  function card() {
  return (
    <div>card</div>
  )
  }
  export default card
  ```
